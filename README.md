# Hybrid CNN-LSTM Forecaster
**Scenario Generation for Stochastic Portfolio Optimization**

## Overview
This repository shows the beginning of my researching using deep learning to generate market scenarios for the Two-Stage Stochastic Portfolio Optimizer. I hypothesies that using forecasts could help produce more accurate/profitable portfolios. 

## Progress and News
- Developed an ETL pipeline for the market data.
- Working on a hybrid CNN-LSTM model to forecast the stocks.
- Implimenting GNN into the model.

## Structure
- `src/`: Core model architecture and training scripts.
- `notebooks/`: Data exploration and prototype testing.
- `config.yaml`: Centralized hyperparameter and environment management.
